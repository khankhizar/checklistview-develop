## Usage

```java
// Getting instance
ChecklistManager mChecklistManager = new ChecklistManager(mActivity);

private void toggleCheckList() {
    View newView;

    /*
     * Here is where the job is done. By simply calling an instance of the
     * ChecklistManager we can call its methods.
     */
    try {
        /* 
         * These method are useful when converting from EditText to ChecklistView
         * (but can be set anytime, they'll be used at appropriate moment)
         */

        // Setting new entries hint text (if not set no hint
        // will be used)
        mChecklistManager.setNewEntryHint(prefs.getString("settings_hint", ""));
        // Let checked items are moved on bottom
        mChecklistManager.setMoveCheckedOnBottom(Integer.valueOf(prefs.getString(
            "settings_checked_items_behavior", "0")));


        /* 
         * These method are useful when converting from ChecklistView to EditText 
         * (but can be set anytime, they'll be used at appropriate moment)
         */

        // Decide if keep or remove checked items when converting 
        // back to simple text from checklist
        mChecklistManager.setKeepChecked(prefs.getBoolean("settings_keep_checked", true));
        // I want to make checks symbols visible when converting 
        // back to simple text from checklist
        mChecklistManager.setShowChecks(prefs.getBoolean("settings_show_checks", false));

        // Converting actual EditText into a View that can
        // replace the source or viceversa
        newView = mChecklistManager.convert(switchView);
        // Replacing view in the layout
        mChecklistManager.replaceViews(switchView, newView);
        // Updating the instance of the pointed view for
        // eventual reverse conversion
        switchView = newView;
    } catch (ViewNotSupportedException e) {
        // This exception is fired if the source view class is not supported
        ...
    }
}
```
